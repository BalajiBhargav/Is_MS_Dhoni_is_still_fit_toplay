# Is_MS_Dhoni_is_still_fit_toplay
## From the visualizations it is clear that MS Dhoni is struggling with bat from past 2 Years
## He scored less that 250 runs in both 2020 and 2021 season whereas before 2020 he has minimun 300 runs in every season.
## 2018 and 2019 are best for MS Dhoni in terms of runs scored in season, strike rate and runs per innings
## Strike rate dropped to below 120 in 2020 and below 100 in 2020
## His runs per innings also dropped from past 2 years
## Finally MS Dhoni is not fit to bat but Dhoni is known for his comebacks hoping 2022 is a good year for him.
